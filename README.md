The CNC Torch Table allows workshops to create replacement parts on the fly for many of the components used in the GVCS. Additionally, the Torch Table gives workshops the ability to create many of the custom components used in the GVCS Machines. Many parts that make up the 50 GVCS Tools can be cut on the CNC Torch Table, making this machine valuable for replication.
