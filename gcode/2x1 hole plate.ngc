M119 (2 hole x 1 hole plate)

Notes:
* Feed the instructions 1 at a time to marlin. Sometimes multiple instructions sent at once cause them to be run wrong.
* M119s are because you need a gcode before comments on marlin and I thought it was harmless, but it might be messing up timings so don't send them.

M119 (Does piercing away from edges)
M119 (Doesn't preheat metal or account for torch width)

M119 (Last time I ran this the holes came out wrong but they worked previously. Maybe there's a bug or maybe I send too many instructions at once to the firmware. Maybe the M119's are breaking stuff by tying up too much time while control is going on.)

M119 (TODO adjust z vals for half inch metal once torch is mounted)
